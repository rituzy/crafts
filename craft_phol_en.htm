	<h2>Photos' properties lister.</h2>
        Accidently all our photos were edited as one bunch so date created became the date of this editing. And I created a small app for looking through all images in selected folder and collecting picture properties like size, quality, date of the shot, camera model and others. After collecting this data the app creates a table (csv file) where you can analyze the data for further editing and scaffolding.</br>
    <b>Important points: </b>
    <ul>
		<li> multithreading is missing since it takes minutes to analyze a big folder with photos</li>
	</ul>
	<b>Features:</b>
	<ul>
		<li> looks for images recursively </li>
		<li> there is a logging (java.util.logging libruary)</li>
	</ul>
