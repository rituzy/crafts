	<h2>Parser for football site.</h2>
     One of my friends makes some analysis on football matches: he goes to the football site to this match's statistics and copies the matche's details field by field to excel. Finally he got tired from this routine and asked me to create an app which can do all the routine so he would only make his analysis in excel. After googling and looking ghrough the sites html source code I created this small app. It gets the site's content, parses it and then write result (table) to csv file. Project is created in NetBeans.</br>
    <b>Important points: </b>
    <ul>
		<li> No multithreading as the app is too small and does not use any difficult calculations</li>
		<li> Russian interface</li>
	</ul>
	<b>Features:</b>
	<ul>
		<li> You can use it for your own parsed (the model of the app is ready) </li>
		<li> Pattern strategy is used here </li>
	</ul>
